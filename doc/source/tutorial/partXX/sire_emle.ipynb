    "\n",
    "The `sire` QM/MM implementation takes advantage of the new means of writing [platform independent force calculations](http://docs.openmm.org/development/developerguide/09_customcppforceimpl.html) introduced in [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/) 8.1. This allows us to interface with any external package to modify atomic forces within the OpenMM context. While OpenMM already directly supports ML/MM simulations via the [OpenMM-ML](https://github.com/openmm/openmm-ml) package, it is currently limited to specific backends and only supports mechanical embedding. The `sire` QM/MM implementation performs the QM calculation using the [emle-engine](https://github.com/chemle/emle-engine) package, which has support for a wide range of backends and embedding models, importantly providing a simple and efficient ML model for electrostatic embedding.\n",
