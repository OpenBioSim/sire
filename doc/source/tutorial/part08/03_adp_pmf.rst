Alanine-dipeptide conformational landscape
==========================================

..note::

    The code in this tutorial was adapted from `FastMBAR <https://fastmbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dialanine_PMF.html>`_.

In a recent `preprint <https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65dcb08d66c1381729975125>`_
we used the ``emle-engine`` interface to ``sander`` to compute free-energy
surfaces for alanine-dipeptide as a function of the Φ and Ψ dihedral
angles shown below. Compared to regular mechanical embedding, ``EMLE`` was
found to be closer to the reference density-functional theory (DFT) surface.
In this tutorial we will show how to use the ``sire-emle`` interface to set
up and run the same calculations using ``OpenMM``.

Creating a context with sire-emle
---------------------------------

As in the previous section, we can first use ``sire-emle`` to create
a QM/MM capable dynamics object for the alanine-dipeptide example
system. We can then extract the underlying ``OpenMM`` context from
this.

First we will create an ``EMLECalculator`` to compute the QM intramolecular
interaction using `ANI-2x <https://aiqm.github.io/torchani>`_ along with
the electrostatic embedding interaction.

>>> from emle import EMLECalculator
>>> calculator = EMLECalculator(device="cpu")

Next we will load the alanine-dipeptide system using ``sire``:

>>> import sire as sr
>>> mols = sr.load_test_files("ala.crd", "ala.top")

We can then create an ``EMLEEngine`` that can be be used to perform QM/MM:

>>> qm_mols, engine = sr.qm.emle(mols, mols[0], calculator)

Here the first argument is the molecules that we are simulating, the second
selection coresponding to the QM region (here this is the first molecule), and
the third is calculator that was created above. The fourth and fifth arguments
are optional, and specify the QM cutoff distance and the neigbour list update
frequency respectively. (Shown are the default values.) The function returns a
modified version of the molecules containing a "merged" dipeptide that can be
interpolated between MM and QM levels of theory, along with an engine. The
engine registers a Python callback that uses ``emle-engine`` to perform the QM
calculation.

We can now create a ``dynamics`` that will create an ``OpenMM`` context for us
and can be used to run a simulation:

>>> d = mols.dynamics(
...     timestep="1fs",
...     constraint="none",
...     engine=engine,
...     platform="cpu",
... )

Before extracting the context we will use the dynamics object to minimise the
alanine-dipeptide system:

>>> d.minimise()

Setting up umbrella sampling with OpenMM
----------------------------------------

We can now extract the underlying ``OpenMM`` context from the dynamics object,
then create a copy of the integrator and system.

>>> from copy import deepcopy
>>> context = d.context()
>>> omm_system = context.getSystem()
>>> integrator = deepcopy(context.getIntegrator())

In order to perform umbrella sampling we will need to add a biasing potentials
for the two dihedral angles. Here we will use simple harmonic biasing potentials:

First the Φ dihedral, which is formed by atom indices 4, 6, 8, and 14:

>>> import openmm
>>> import openmm.app
>>> bias_torsion_phi = openmm.CustomTorsionForce(
...     "0.5*k_phi*dtheta^2; dtheta = min(tmp, 2*pi-tmp); tmp = abs(theta - phi)"
... )
>>> bias_torsion_phi.addGlobalParameter("pi", math.pi)
>>> bias_torsion_phi.addGlobalParameter("k_phi", 100.0)
>>> bias_torsion_phi.addGlobalParameter("phi", 0.0)
>>> bias_torsion_phi.addTorsion(4, 6, 8, 14)

Next the Ψ dihedral, which is formed by atom indices 6, 8, 14, and 16:

>>> bias_torsion_psi = openmm.CustomTorsionForce(
...     "0.5*k_psi*dtheta^2; dtheta = min(tmp, 2*pi-tmp); tmp = abs(theta - psi)"
... )
>>> bias_torsion_psi.addGlobalParameter("pi", math.pi)
>>> bias_torsion_psi.addGlobalParameter("k_psi", 100.0)
>>> bias_torsion_psi.addGlobalParameter("psi", 0.0)
>>> bias_torsion_psi.addTorsion(6, 8, 14, 16)

We can now add these forces to the system:

>>> omm_system.addForce(bias_torsion_phi)
>>> omm_system.addForce(bias_torsion_psi)

In order to run the simulation we will create a new context using the system
and integrator and set the initial positions.

>>> new_context = openmm.Context(omm_system, integrator, context.getPlatform())
>>> new_context.setPositions(context.getState(getPositions=True).getPositions())

Running the simulation
----------------------

We are almost ready to run an umbrella sampling simulation. In this example we
will sample the Φ and Ψ dihedral angles on a 36x36 grid. We will first set the
biasing potential centers:

>>> m = 36
>>> M = m * m
>>> phi = np.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, m, endpoint=False)
>>> psi = np.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, m, endpoint=False)

During the simulation we will save trajectories to disk which can later be
post-processed to compute the dihedral angles. We will create a directory
in which to store the files:

>>> os.makedirs("./output/traj", exist_ok=True)

The sampling is performed by looping over each of the umbrella windows
sequentially. For each window we set the biasing potential center and run
an initial equilibration of 5000 steps. We then run a production simulation
of 100 cycles of 100 steps each, saving trajectory after each cycle:

>>> for idx in range(M):
... phi_index = idx // m
... psi_index = idx % m
...
... # Set the center of the biasing potentials.
... new_context.setParameter("phi", phi[phi_index])
... new_context.setParameter("psi", psi[psi_index])
...
... # Initial equilibrium.
... integrator.step(5000)
...
... # Production sampling.
... file_handle = open(f"./output/traj/phi_{phi_index}_phi_{psi_index}.dcd", "bw")
... dcd_file = DCDFile(file_handle, prm.topology, dt=integrator.getStepSize())
... for x in range(100):
...     integrator.step(100)
...     state = new_context.getState(getPositions=True)
...     positions = state.getPositions()
...     dcd_file.writeModel(positions)
... file_handle.close()

..note::

    This is not a particulary efficient way to perform the sampling. In practice,
    since it's possible to get good single core performance it is better to run
    the windows in parallel, either individually, or in blocks.

Analysing the results
---------------------

The trajectories saved to disk can be post-processed to compute the dihedral
angles, for example using the approach
`here <https://fastmbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dialanine_PMF.html#compute-and-collect-values-of-both-dialanine-dihedral>`_.
The free-energy surface can then be compute using MBAR, or UWHAM. Example code
is provided in the `FastMBAR tutorial <https://fastmbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dialanine_PMF.html#use-fastmbar-to-solve-mbar-uwham-equations-and-compute-the-pmf>`_.

The resulting free-energy surface should look similar to the one shown below:
